## üß† About Me

I'm a Senior Software Developer with a strong background in C++ and extensive experience building performant, reliable, and maintainable software systems. My expertise spans low-level systems programming, desktop application development with Qt, cross-platform toolchains, and automation using Python.

I focus on writing efficient, well-architected code, and have a passion for solving complex technical challenges. Whether it‚Äôs working close to the metal or architecting modular software components, I bring a pragmatic and detail-oriented mindset to every project.
